#### _Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree_

## Project Brief

* Convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application (making the website responsive and accessible for screen reader use). 
* Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### How to run:

1. Clone repo, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
